## 📖 Abstract

**The Iron Protocol** is a comprehensive, semester-by-semester execution plan for Computer Science, Software Engineering, and IT students. 

It rejects the modern trend of "Vibe Coding" and passive tutorial consumption. Instead, it enforces a strict regimen of **Fundamentals First**, **Linux Literacy**, and **Systems Thinking**.

**Goal:** To graduate not just with a degree, but as an industry-ready engineer who can build, deploy, and scale complex systems.

---

## ⚖️ The Core Directives (RFC 2026)

All participants of The Iron Protocol must adhere to the following immutable laws:

1. **NO MAGIC (The AI Clause):** You MUST NOT use AI (ChatGPT/Copilot) to generate code you cannot write yourself. AI is a tutor, not a writer.
2. **CLOSE TO THE METAL:** You MUST use the Command Line Interface (CLI) for file management, git, and compilation. GUIs are a luxury.
3. **ACTIVE CREATION:** For every 1 hour of consumption (video/reading), you MUST spend 3 hours in creation (coding).
4. **THE LAW OF STRUGGLE:** When encountering an error, you MUST struggle with it for at least 20 minutes before seeking external help.

## 🗺️ The Protocol Roadmap

The curriculum is divided into four distinct phases. Click a phase to view the detailed directives.

| Phase | Codename | Focus Area | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Year 1** | **[📂 GENESIS](./01_GENESIS)** | Logic, C++, Memory, Linux Boot Camp | `FOUNDATION` |
| **Year 2** | **[📂 ARCHITECTURE](./02_ARCHITECTURE)** | DSA, Networking, OS, Docker | `CORE` |
| **Year 3** | **[📂 SPECIALIZATION](./03_SPECIALIZATION)** | Cloud, Agentic AI, Cybersec, Mobile | `DEPTH` |
| **Year 4** | **[📂 MASTERY](./04_MASTERY)** | Final Year Project, System Design, Career | `DEPLOY` |

---

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Phase I)

If you are just starting, your immediate objectives are:

- [ ] **Sign The Oath:** Read and commit to [OATH.md](./OATH.md). This is your contract with excellence.
- [ ] **Nuke Windows:** Install Ubuntu, Fedora, or Pop!_OS as your daily driver.
- [ ] **Hello World:** Write a C++ program using only `vim` or `nano` and compile it with `g++`.
- [ ] **Commit:** Push your first code using Git CLI.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **Breadth first, specialization later** — Build strong fundamentals in Years 1–2. Explore multiple fields in Year 2. Specialize in Year 3–4.
2. **Coding is non-negotiable** — No matter your title (CS, SE, AI, DS, Security), you must be able to write and understand code.
3. **Problem-solving > tools** — Languages and frameworks change. The ability to think clearly and break down problems does not.
4. **Attention is your superpower** — Protect your focus from Shorts, Reels, TikTok, and endless scrolling. Deep work beats scattered attention.
5. **Connected learning** — Don't memorize isolated facts. Always link new concepts to things you already know.
6. **AI is a tool, not your brain** — Use AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) to **understand and verify**, not to copy answers blindly.
7. **Portfolio > GPA in industry** — A strong website, GitHub, and projects often matter more than your exact CGPA in job interviews.

## ✅ Minimum Habits for Everyone (No Matter the Year)

- **Code every day** (even 20–30 minutes).
- **Type correctly** (improve WPM).
- **Use Linux regularly** (especially in Years 1–2).
- **Ask good questions** (write → narrow → search → then ask).
- **Work on at least one project each semester**.
- **Update your GitHub and website regularly**.

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- Students in **any year** (1st to 4th) of CS/SE/IT programs
- Students who want to be **employable**, not just degree-holders
- Students willing to put in **consistent daily effort**
- Anyone who refuses to be an "average" graduate

## ⚠️ Who This Is NOT For

- Students seeking shortcuts or "24-hour" mastery
- Those unwilling to leave their comfort zone (Windows, GUIs, copy-paste)
- Passive learners expecting results without struggle
- Anyone looking for participation trophies

---

## 🧑‍💻 For Faculty / Mentors

- Use this protocol as an **unofficial "skills curriculum"** on top of formal courses
- Encourage students to follow the **parallel tracks** (web dev, sysadmin, projects)
- Use the **Skills Matrix** and **Checklists** for mentoring sessions and 1:1s
- Point students to specific sections when they ask, "What should I do now?"

---

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a living document. If you have:

- **Corrections or improvements** to the roadmap
- **Resources** to add (courses, books, tools)
- **Experience reports** from following the protocol
- **Translations** to other languages

## 🔥 Final Words

**The Iron Protocol is not about perfection. It's about consistency.**

You don't need to be the smartest person in the room. You need to be the most persistent.

Show up every day. Code every day. Build every semester. Struggle through errors. Push through frustration.

By Year 4, you will not recognize the person you were in Year 1.

**That is the goal.**
