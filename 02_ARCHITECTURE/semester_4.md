# 📌 Semester 4 – Core CS II (OS, Networks, Databases)

> **Goal:** Understand how software interacts with the OS, network stack, and data layer.

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- Explain processes, threads, scheduling, and memory management.
- Build a client/server program over TCP.
- Design a normalized database schema and write SQL queries.

---

## 📚 Typical University Courses

- Operating Systems
- Computer Networks
- Database Systems
- Elective / Gen‑Ed

---

## 🛠 Parallel Track (Self‑Directed)

### OS Labs (Weekly)

- Process creation & scheduling simulation
- Memory allocation (paging / segmentation)
- File system concepts

### Networks Labs (Weekly)

- Build a TCP client/server
- Packet flow: DNS → HTTP → Response
- Subnetting & routing basics

### Databases (Weekly)

- Normalization (1NF → 3NF)
- Joins, aggregates, indexes
- Build a CRUD app with SQL backend

---

## 📦 Projects (Choose 1–2)

1. **Mini Shell** – simple command parsing + process execution.
2. **Chat App** – TCP client/server with message history in SQL.
3. **Networked File Indexer** – small server that indexes files and supports search.

## ✅ Semester 4 Checklist

- [ ] I can explain process vs thread and context switching.
- [ ] I built at least one socket‑based program.
- [ ] I can design a normalized DB schema.
- [ ] I can write multi‑table joins confidently.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Treating OS/Networks as pure theory.
- ❌ Skipping labs (the labs *are* the learning).
- ❌ Ignoring DB normalization and indexing.
