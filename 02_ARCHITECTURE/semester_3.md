# 📌 Semester 3 – Core CS I (Data Structures & Algorithms)

> **Goal:** Build strong DSA fundamentals, connect code to memory, and develop repeatable problem‑solving habits.

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- Implement core data structures from scratch.
- Analyze time/space complexity confidently.
- Explain how DS map to memory and CPU behavior.
- Build at least 1 DSA‑centric project.

---

## 📚 Typical University Courses

- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Computer Organization / Architecture
- Discrete Math II / Logic
- Elective / Gen‑Ed

---

## 🛠 Parallel Track (Self‑Directed)

### Weekly Practice (3–5 hrs/week)

- Solve **2–3 DSA problems** weekly.
- Focus on patterns, not memorization.
- Keep a “pattern notebook.”

**Core Topics:**
- Arrays, strings
- Linked lists
- Stacks, queues, deques
- Trees (BST, heap basics)
- Hashing
- Recursion & backtracking
- Time/space complexity

### Conceptual Bridge (1–2 hrs/week)

- How arrays map to memory
- Pointers/references in your language
- Stack vs heap (why recursion matters)

---

## 📦 Projects (Choose 1–2)

1. **DS Toolkit** – Implement stack, queue, linked list, BST, heap in one repo.
2. **Algorithm Visualizer** – Show sorting and searching visually.
3. **Problem‑Solver CLI** – A CLI app that solves classic DS problems and explains complexity.

## ✅ Semester 3 Checklist

- [ ] I can implement stack/queue/linked list from scratch.
- [ ] I can explain $O(n)$, $O(n\log n)$, $O(n^2)$ clearly.
- [ ] I solved 20–30 curated problems.
- [ ] I shipped at least one DSA project.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Memorizing solutions instead of patterns.
- ❌ Skipping complexity analysis.
- ❌ Doing theory without implementing.

## 🔗 Reinforcement (Optional)

- [LeetCode, HackerRank, TopCoder are Bad for Programming Newbies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb8zsbtgmSI) — focus on patterns before grinding.
- [Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Oi74K9p18) — slow, deliberate practice and long‑term skill building.
