# 🟩 Year 2 – ARCHITECTURE (Core Computer Science)

> **Year 2 Goal:** Master the fundamentals of computer science (data structures, algorithms, OS, networks, databases) and explore multiple specialization areas to discover what you enjoy.

---

## 📂 Your Year 2 Evidence (The Architecture Portfolio)
By the end of this year, you must have a GitHub repository named `iron-protocol-year-2` containing:

1. **The Pattern Book (DSA):** 30+ DSA solutions grouped by *pattern* (not random), each with a "Why this pattern?" explanation.
2. **The Systems Lab:** Verifiable artifacts (code + logs) from your OS and Networking labs.
3. **The Database Schema:** A complex, normalized database design (3NF) for a real-world problem.
4. **The Exploration Memo:** A 2-page document justifying your choice of specialization for Year 3 based on your Summer Sprint.

## 🧭 Year 2 Overview

Year 2 is where you transition from **builder** to **computer scientist**.

You will:
- Solidify **data structures and algorithms** (the interview gatekeepers)
- Understand **how computers actually work** (OS, networks, hardware)
- Build **database-backed applications** at scale
- **Explore 5+ fields** (ML, security, mobile, cloud, data engineering) to find your passion
 - Use **Recluze playlists** for reinforcement (Intermediate Python before DSA, OS/Networks during labs)

**Philosophy:** Breadth before depth. Don't specialize yet. Explore everything, then choose.

## 🎯 Year 2 Success Criteria

By the end of Year 2, you should be able to:

- [ ] Implement common **data structures** from scratch (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- [ ] Analyze **time and space complexity** of algorithms
- [ ] Solve **LeetCode Medium** problems independently
- [ ] Explain how **processes, threads, and memory** work in an OS
- [ ] Write **socket programs** (TCP client/server)
- [ ] Design and implement a **normalized database schema**
- [ ] Write complex **SQL queries** (joins, subqueries, aggregations)
- [ ] Have built "Hello World" projects in **5+ different fields**
- [ ] Know which specialization excites you for Year 3

## 🧠 Why Year 2 is Critical

**Interviews:** Most technical interviews test DSA + system design. Year 2 builds this foundation.

**Specialization:** You can't choose a path without trying multiple options. Year 2 lets you explore.

**Fundamentals:** Frameworks come and go. Data structures, algorithms, OS, and networks are timeless.

## ⚠️ Common Year 2 Mistakes

### ❌ **Memorizing solutions instead of patterns**
LeetCode is about recognizing patterns, not memorizing 1000 solutions.

### ❌ **Skipping the "boring" theory**
OS and networks seem abstract until you're debugging production issues. Learn them now.

### ❌ **Specializing too early**
"I only want to do ML" limits you. Try everything in Year 2, specialize in Year 3.

### ❌ **Only doing coursework**
University teaches theory. You must build projects to apply concepts.

### ❌ **Ignoring complexity analysis**
"My code works" isn't enough. Does it scale? What's the time complexity?

## 💡 Pro Tips for Year 2

1. **Solve 2-3 DSA problems per week** (consistent practice > weekend binges)
2. **Implement everything yourself first** before using libraries
3. **Connect theory to practice** (relate OS concepts to Docker, networking to web apps)
4. **Keep a "Second Brain"** (notes, diagrams, code snippets)
5. **Teach to learn** (explain concepts to peers or in blog posts)
