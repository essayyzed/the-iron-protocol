# ☀️ Summer Break 2 – Exploration Sprint

> **The Discovery Phase**: Explore 5 CS domains to find your calling

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Explore **5 major CS specialization areas**
- Build **1 small project** in each domain
- Discover what excites you
- Make an **informed choice** for Year 3 specialization

**Why This Matters:** Most students pick specializations randomly or based on course grades. This summer gives you real experience to make a better choice.
