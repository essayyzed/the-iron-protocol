# 💼 Career Preparation Guide

## 🧠 The Mindset Shift

### ❌ Wrong Mindset
"Please hire me, I need a job, I'll take any salary"

### ✅ Right Mindset
"I can solve X problem for you, here's proof (portfolio), let's discuss value"

**Remember:** Companies hire value, not need.

---

## 📄 CV Best Practices

### Structure (1-2 pages max)
1. **Header** (Name, Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Portfolio)
2. **Summary** (2-3 lines, optional but strong)
3. **Experience** (internships, projects, work)
4. **Education** (degree, university, CGPA if >3.0)
5. **Skills** (categorized: Languages, Frameworks, Tools)
6. **Projects** (3-5 best, with links)

### The "You Attitude"
Frame everything around value YOU provide:

**Bad:**
- "Worked on a web app"
- "Learned React"
- "Helped with testing"

**Good:**
- "Built CRUD web app serving 100+ users, reducing data entry time by 50%"
- "Developed responsive frontend using React, improving load time by 30%"
- "Implemented automated testing suite, catching 40+ bugs before production"

### Quantify Everything
- Number of users
- Performance improvements (%)
- Team size
- Lines of code (if impressive)
- Time saved
- Features shipped

### Tech Stack Clarity
For each project:
```
Project Name | Tech Stack | Link
Built X using Y and Z. Achieved [outcome].
```
