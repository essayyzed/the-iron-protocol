4. **Build from first principles** - Don't just use libraries, understand them
5. **Website > LinkedIn** - Portfolio matters more than profile
6. **Don't specialize too early** - Keep doors open in early years
7. **Central concepts matter** - Remember the core, details will follow
8. **Attention span is key** - Avoid shorts, reels, and surface-level content
