# 📌 Semester 1 – Foundations & Habits

> **The Purist Phase**: Logic, C++, Memory, Linux Boot Camp

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **problem-solving mindset**
- Establish **core habits**: typing, Linux, asking good questions
- Learn the **basics of computing and programming**
- Get comfortable with **discomfort**

---

## 📌 Evidence You Must Produce (Non-Negotiable)
By the end of Semester 1 you must have a GitHub repo named `semester-1-foundations` containing:

1. `projects/cli-calculator/` (code + README + sample runs)
2. `projects/text-game/` (code + README + sample runs)
3. `linux-setup.md` (your install + what broke + screenshots)
4. `notes/` with at least **8 short notes** (1 per week) answering:
   - what you learned
   - what confused you
   - what you built
   - what you will do next week

If it’s not in a repo with a README, it doesn’t count.

## 📚 University Courses (Typical)

- Introduction to Computing
- Programming Fundamentals (C/C++/Python/Java)
- Calculus I or Discrete Mathematics I
- English/Communication

## 🛠 Parallel Track (Self-Directed)

### Daily Habits

#### ⌨️ **Touch Typing Practice (15 minutes/day)**

**Tools:**
- [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/)
- [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/)
- [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)

**Target:** 35+ WPM by end of semester

**Why?** You'll spend thousands of hours typing code. This is an investment that pays dividends forever.

#### 🐧 **Linux as Primary OS (30-60 minutes/day)**

**Action Steps:**
1. **Install Linux** (dual boot or primary):
   - Ubuntu 22.04+ (beginner-friendly)
   - Fedora (intermediate)
   - Pop!_OS (good for students)

2. **Do ALL your coursework in Linux**
   - Write assignments in LibreOffice/LaTeX
   - Code in vim/nano/VSCode
   - Browse, email, everything

3. **Learn Terminal Basics:**

```bash
# Navigation
ls          # list files
cd          # change directory
pwd         # print working directory

# File operations
cp          # copy
mv          # move/rename
rm          # remove (CAREFUL!)
mkdir       # make directory
touch       # create empty file

# Viewing files
cat         # display file content
less        # view file with scrolling
head        # first lines
tail        # last lines

# Search
grep        # search in files
find        # find files
man         # manual pages
```

**Weekly Challenge:** Learn 3 new terminal commands each week.

---

### Weekly Tasks

#### 📺 **Watch Educational Content (2-3 videos/week)**

**Receipts Rule:** For each video, you must create a file:
`notes/video-<title>.md` with:
- 5 bullet points of what you learned
- 1 small program you wrote because of it (link to code)
- 1 question you still have
No note = the video doesn’t count.

**Recommended Playlists:**
- [Introduction to Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rms6Dv3n6d0&list=PLnd7R4Mcw3rLmfW78NJnXXaso1BNB9Kym) - Recluze
- [How to Approach Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnd7R4Mcw3rKuL5CILi8CQ35UDFbWimbR) - Recluze (27 videos)
- [CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380F_inVRXMIHCqLaNUd7bN4) - Harvard

**Must-Watch from "How to Approach Learning":**
1. [How to Use the Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyf1a-mdwJI) - Navigation guide for Recluze content
2. [BS in CS/SE/AI/DS/etc. -- Things to do in first semester!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rms6Dv3n6d0)
3. [Easily Remember Everything You Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPA6hJuvwKg) - Memory techniques
4. [Avoid this One Habit to Boost Your Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UVlsFPjTA)
5. [Boost Your BS in CS/SE/IT - Part 1 Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8MDXrGqxXM)

**Rule:** For every 1 hour watched, code for 3 hours.

#### ❓ **Write Good Questions (1 per week minimum)**

**The Protocol:**
1. **Write** → Articulate your problem clearly
2. **Narrow** → What specifically are you stuck on?
3. **Search** → Google, Stack Overflow, documentation
4. **Ask** → If still stuck, ask with context

**Template:**
```
I'm trying to: [goal]
I expected: [expected result]
I got: [actual result]
I've tried: [solutions attempted]
My code: [relevant snippet]
Error message: [if any]
```

**Non-negotiable:** You must include a **minimal reproducible example**:
- smallest input that breaks your code
- smallest snippet that reproduces the bug
If your question cannot be reproduced, it is not a “good question” yet.

#### 🧠 The 20-Minute Struggle (Structured)
Before asking for help, do this:

- **5 min:** write expected vs actual output
- **5 min:** read the error *slowly* and search the exact message
- **5 min:** reduce to the smallest failing case
- **5 min:** run 1–2 experiments (print statements / logging / simpler inputs)

When you ask, include what you tried + what changed.

#### 👥 **Study Group (Weekly meetings)**

Find or form a **goal-oriented study group** (3-5 students).

**Not for:** Copying assignments, socializing only  
**For:** Discussing concepts, debugging together, accountability

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ **Skipping typing practice**
*"I'll do it later"* = never. Start now.

### ❌ **Staying in Windows/Mac comfort zone**
You won't learn problem-solving without friction.

### ❌ **Copying code without understanding**
Type it out. Break it. Fix it. That's how you learn.

### ❌ **Not asking questions**
Fear of "looking dumb" is how you stay dumb. Ask.

### ❌ **Waiting for perfection**
Your first projects will be ugly. That's okay. Ship them anyway.
