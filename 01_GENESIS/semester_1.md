## 🛠 Parallel Track (Self-Directed)

### Daily Habits

#### ⌨️ **Touch Typing Practice (15 minutes/day)**

**Tools:**
- [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/)
- [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/)
- [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)

**Target:** 35+ WPM by end of semester

**Why?** You'll spend thousands of hours typing code. This is an investment that pays dividends forever.

#### 🐧 **Linux as Primary OS (30-60 minutes/day)**

**Action Steps:**
1. **Install Linux** (dual boot or primary):
   - Ubuntu 22.04+ (beginner-friendly)
   - Fedora (intermediate)
   - Pop!_OS (good for students)

2. **Do ALL your coursework in Linux**
   - Write assignments in LibreOffice/LaTeX
   - Code in vim/nano/VSCode
   - Browse, email, everything

3. **Learn Terminal Basics:**

```bash
# Navigation
ls          # list files
cd          # change directory
pwd         # print working directory

# File operations
cp          # copy
mv          # move/rename
rm          # remove (CAREFUL!)
mkdir       # make directory
touch       # create empty file

# Viewing files
cat         # display file content
less        # view file with scrolling
head        # first lines
tail        # last lines

# Search
grep        # search in files
find        # find files
man         # manual pages
```

**Weekly Challenge:** Learn 3 new terminal commands each week.

---

### Weekly Tasks

#### 📺 **Watch Educational Content (2-3 videos/week)**

**Recommended Playlists:**
- [Introduction to Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rms6Dv3n6d0&list=PLnd7R4Mcw3rLmfW78NJnXXaso1BNB9Kym) - Recluze
- [CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380F_inVRXMIHCqLaNUd7bN4) - Harvard

**Rule:** For every 1 hour watched, code for 3 hours.

#### ❓ **Write Good Questions (1 per week minimum)**

**The Protocol:**
1. **Write** → Articulate your problem clearly
2. **Narrow** → What specifically are you stuck on?
3. **Search** → Google, Stack Overflow, documentation
4. **Ask** → If still stuck, ask with context

**Template:**
```
I'm trying to: [goal]
I expected: [expected result]
I got: [actual result]
I've tried: [solutions attempted]
My code: [relevant snippet]
Error message: [if any]
```

#### 👥 **Study Group (Weekly meetings)**

Find or form a **goal-oriented study group** (3-5 students).

**Not for:** Copying assignments, socializing only  
**For:** Discussing concepts, debugging together, accountability

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ **Skipping typing practice**
*"I'll do it later"* = never. Start now.

### ❌ **Staying in Windows/Mac comfort zone**
You won't learn problem-solving without friction.

### ❌ **Copying code without understanding**
Type it out. Break it. Fix it. That's how you learn.

### ❌ **Not asking questions**
Fear of "looking dumb" is how you stay dumb. Ask.

### ❌ **Waiting for perfection**
Your first projects will be ugly. That's okay. Ship them anyway.
