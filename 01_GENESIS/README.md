# 🟦 Year 1 – GENESIS (Foundations & Practical Skills)

> **Year 1 Goal:** Build solid foundations in problem-solving, typing, Linux, and web development. Start your journey as a real builder, not a passive student.

---

## 📂 Your Year 1 Evidence (The Portfolio)
By the end of this year, you must have a single GitHub repository named `iron-protocol-year-1` (or a website) containing:

1. **Semester 1 Lab Book:** A folder of your first 10–20 C++/Python programs with a `README.md` explaining the logic of each.
2. **The "Nuke Windows" Receipt:** A screenshot of your Linux desktop + your `dotfiles` (config files).
3. **The Confidence Builder:** A link to a live, deployed Full-Stack CRUD application.
4. **The Server Log:** A documented record of your VPS setup, Docker containers, and security hardening.

**If you don't have these four things, you didn't finish Year 1.**

## 🧭 Year 1 Overview

This is where it all begins. Year 1 is about **unlearning bad habits** and **building the right foundations**.

## 📂 Your Year 1 Evidence (The Portfolio)
By the end of this year, you must have a single GitHub repository named `iron-protocol-year-1` (or a website) containing:

1. **Semester 1 Lab Book:** A folder of your first 10-20 C++/Python programs with a `README.md` explaining the logic of each.
2. **The "Nuke Windows" Receipt:** A screenshot of your Linux desktop + your `dotfiles` (config files).
3. **The Confidence Builder:** A link to a live, deployed Full-Stack CRUD application.
4. **The Server Log:** A documented record of your VPS setup, Docker containers, and security hardening.

**If you don't have these four things, you didn't finish Year 1.**

You will:
- Learn **how to learn** effectively
- Build a **problem-solving mindset**
- Master **Linux** and the **terminal**
- Learn **basic programming** fundamentals
- Build your **first websites and apps**
- Create your **GitHub account** and start your portfolio

**Warning:** This year will feel uncomfortable. You'll struggle with the terminal, make countless errors, and question why you're doing this "the hard way." That's the point. The struggle is where the learning happens.

## 🎯 Year 1 Success Criteria

By the end of Year 1, you should be able to:

- [ ] **Typing:** 40+ WPM on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) (15-minute test).
- [ ] **OS:** Zero dependency on Windows/macOS for dev work.
- [ ] **CLI:** Can perform all file operations, git commands, and compilation without a GUI.
- [ ] **Programming:** Can solve "LeetCode Easy" level problems in C++/Python without AI.
- [ ] **Web:** A deployed CRUD app with Auth + Input Validation + Error Handling.
- [ ] **Git:** 100+ meaningful commits across your Year 1 projects.
- [ ] **Ops:** A hardened VPS running at least 2 containerized services via Docker Compose.
- [ ] **Communication:** 5+ "Good Questions" asked in public forums (Issues/Discord) with full context.

## 🛠️ Protocol Modes (Choose Your Path)
We know not everyone has a dedicated high-end laptop. Choose the mode that fits your constraints:

- **Full Iron Mode:** Nuke Windows. Linux is your only OS. (Recommended for maximum growth).
- **Hybrid/Budget Mode:** Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for daily coding + a 2-hour "Linux Only" session every weekend at a lab or on a live USB.
- **Cloud Mode:** If your hardware is very weak, use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for a full Linux environment in the browser.

**Constraint is not an excuse. It is a design requirement.**

## ⚠️ Common Year 1 Mistakes

### ❌ **Staying in the Comfort Zone**
Don't stay on Windows with VSCode and mouse-driven workflows. You won't learn systems thinking.

### ❌ **Tutorial Hell**
Watching 50 hours of videos without building anything is worthless. Build > Watch.

### ❌ **Skipping Linux**
"I'll learn it later" = never. Do it now. Your Year 2-4 success depends on it.

### ❌ **Copy-Pasting Without Understanding**
Every line of code you write should make sense to you. If it doesn't, stop and learn why.

### ❌ **Not Using Git Early**
Don't wait until a professor forces you. Start version controlling everything now.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Year 1

1. **Join a goal-oriented study group** (3-5 serious students)
2. **The 1:3 Rule:** For every 20 minutes of video you watch, you must spend 60 minutes writing code related to that video. If you didn't write code, the video didn't happen.
3. **Embrace the struggle** (20-minute rule before asking for help)
4. **Build in public** (share your projects, even if imperfect)
5. **Stay consistent** (daily coding > weekend binges)

## 📂 What's in This Phase?

- **[Semester 1](./semester_1.md)** – The foundation phase: typing, Linux, basic programming, problem-solving
- **[Semester 2](./semester_2.md)** – The confidence builder: full-stack web development, GitHub, deployments
- **[Summer Break 1](./sysadmin_bootcamp.md)** – The missing semester: servers, Docker, system administration

## 🔥 Ready to Begin?

Read and sign **[OATH.md](../OATH.md)** first, then start with **[Semester 1](./semester_1.md)**.
