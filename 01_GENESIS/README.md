# 🟦 Year 1 – GENESIS (Foundations & Practical Skills)

> **Year 1 Goal:** Build solid foundations in problem-solving, typing, Linux, and web development. Start your journey as a real builder, not a passive student.

## 🧭 Year 1 Overview

This is where it all begins. Year 1 is about **unlearning bad habits** and **building the right foundations**.

You will:
- Learn **how to learn** effectively
- Build a **problem-solving mindset**
- Master **Linux** and the **terminal**
- Learn **basic programming** fundamentals
- Build your **first websites and apps**
- Create your **GitHub account** and start your portfolio

**Warning:** This year will feel uncomfortable. You'll struggle with the terminal, make countless errors, and question why you're doing this "the hard way." That's the point. The struggle is where the learning happens.

## ⚠️ Common Year 1 Mistakes

### ❌ **Staying in the Comfort Zone**
Don't stay on Windows with VSCode and mouse-driven workflows. You won't learn systems thinking.

### ❌ **Tutorial Hell**
Watching 50 hours of videos without building anything is worthless. Build > Watch.

### ❌ **Skipping Linux**
"I'll learn it later" = never. Do it now. Your Year 2-4 success depends on it.

### ❌ **Copy-Pasting Without Understanding**
Every line of code you write should make sense to you. If it doesn't, stop and learn why.

### ❌ **Not Using Git Early**
Don't wait until a professor forces you. Start version controlling everything now.

3. **Embrace the struggle** (20-minute rule before asking for help)
4. **Build in public** (share your projects, even if imperfect)
5. **Stay consistent** (daily coding > weekend binges)
