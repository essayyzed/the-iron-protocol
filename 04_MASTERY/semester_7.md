## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ **Choosing FYP based on marks, not interest**
You'll spend 6-8 months on this. Pick something you care about.

### ❌ **Underestimating FYP scope**
Better to deliver a polished MVP than an incomplete ambitious project.

### ❌ **Starting applications too late**
Start applying 6 months before graduation.

### ❌ **Generic applications**
Customize resume and cover letter for each company.

### ❌ **Poor online presence**
First impression is often a Google search. Make it count.
