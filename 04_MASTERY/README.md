## ⚠️ Common Year 4 Mistakes

### ❌ **Weak FYP topic**
Choose something impressive that showcases real skills, not a basic CRUD app.

### ❌ **Delaying career prep**
Start in Semester 7, not Semester 8. You need time for iterations.

### ❌ **Generic CV**
"Worked on a project" doesn't cut it. Quantify value: "Built X that achieved Y."

### ❌ **Not applying broadly**
Apply to everything you're 60%+ qualified for. Rejections are normal.

### ❌ **Waiting for "perfect" opportunity**
Take the first good offer. Learn. Switch later if needed.
