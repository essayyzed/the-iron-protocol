## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ **Waiting for the perfect project before applying**
Apply while building. Companies understand you're learning.

### ❌ **Only applying to big companies**
Startups and mid-size companies often provide better learning experiences.

### ❌ **Generic applications**
Customize your resume and cover letter for each company.

### ❌ **Neglecting soft skills**
Technical skills get you the interview. Soft skills get you the offer.

### ❌ **Giving up after rejections**
Rejection is part of the process. Learn and iterate.

## 🎓 Final Year Project (FYP) Planning Sprint

**Why now?** Your FYP proposal is likely due in **Semester 7 (Week 1-4)**. Planning now gives you:
- Time to refine your idea
- Summer Break 3 for preliminary work/research
- First pick of supervisors before they're overbooked
- Reduced stress in Year 4

### Weeks 11-12: FYP Domain Selection

**Step 1: Choose Your Domain**

Based on your Semester 5 specialization:
- Web/Backend → Real-time systems, scalability, microservices
- ML/AI → Computer vision, NLP, recommendation systems
- Security → Penetration testing tools, cryptography, secure systems
- Mobile → Cross-platform frameworks, native performance
- Data → Analytics dashboards, ETL pipelines, data visualization

**Step 2: Problem Identification**

```markdown
## FYP Ideas Template

### Idea 1: [Project Name]
**Problem:** What problem does this solve?
**Users:** Who will use this?
**Novelty:** What makes it different from existing solutions?
**Feasibility:** Can I build this in 6-8 months?
**Tech Stack:** What technologies will I use?
**Learning:** What will I learn from this?
```

**Generate 3-5 ideas**, then narrow to 1-2 strongest.

### Weeks 13-14: Supervisor Search & Proposal Draft

**Finding a Supervisor:**

1. **Research faculty interests:**
   - Check department website for research areas
   - Read recent publications
   - Look at past FYPs they supervised

2. **Make the approach:**
   ```
   Subject: FYP Supervision Request - [Your Name]

   - [Relevant projects/skills]
   - [Any preliminary research done]
   
   I can meet at your convenience to discuss.
   
   Best regards,
   [Your Name]
   ```

3. **Have 2-3 backup options** in case first choice is unavailable.
