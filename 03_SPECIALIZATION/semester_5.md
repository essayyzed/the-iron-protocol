## ✅ Semester 5 Checklist

- [ ] I selected a specialization track based on genuine interest
- [ ] I completed planning and architecture for my flagship project
- [ ] I have at least 50% of my flagship project's MVP features working
- [ ] I'm learning advanced concepts in my chosen domain
- [ ] I have a consistent GitHub contribution pattern
- [ ] I can explain the architecture of my project clearly
- [ ] I documented my project's progress
- [ ] I started building a professional portfolio website

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ **Choosing a track for money/prestige instead of interest**
You'll burn out if you don't enjoy the work. Choose what excites you.

### ❌ **Starting too many projects**
One excellent project > three mediocre ones. Focus.

### ❌ **Building in isolation**
Share progress, get feedback, iterate. Don't wait for perfection.

### ❌ **Ignoring fundamentals**
Don't just use libraries/frameworks. Understand how they work.

### ❌ **Feature creep**
Define MVP clearly and ship it. Add features after launch.
