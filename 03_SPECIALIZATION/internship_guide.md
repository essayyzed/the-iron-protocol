# ☀️ Summer Break 3 – Internship or Intensive Building

> **The Experience Phase**: Gain real-world experience or build intensively

---

## 🤔 The Critical Question: Internship or FYP Focus?

**Common Dilemma:** "Should I do an internship this summer or focus on my Final Year Project?"

### The Answer: Internship (Almost Always)

**Here's why the timeline supports both:**

1. **FYP Planning Happened in Semester 6** (if you followed the Protocol)
   - You already selected domain, found supervisor, drafted proposal
   - Summer Break 3 ≠ FYP planning time
   - FYP execution happens in Year 4 (Semesters 7-8)

2. **Summer = Prime Internship Window**
   - Companies hire summer interns, not "FYP-focused" interns
   - This is THE opportunity for professional experience
   - FYP work happens during academic semesters, not summer

3. **Recluze's Philosophy: "Don't Close Doors"**
   - Fresh graduates should prioritize experience ("Take whatever pay when fresh")
   - "Don't narrow down your expertise" too early
   - Real-world experience teaches what projects can't

### Decision Matrix

| Your Situation | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|:---------------|:---------------|:----------|
| **0 internships** | TAKE ANY INTERNSHIP | Breaks resume barrier, 60-80% better interview rate |
| **1 internship** | TAKE INTERNSHIP (if offered) | Compounds career capital, builds network |
| **2+ internships + FAANG offer** | TAKE FAANG | No-brainer, career-defining |
| **2+ internships + mediocre offer** | Consider building | You have credibility, can afford to focus |
| **No internship offer** | Intensive Building (Track B) | Best alternative, don't waste summer |

### What About My FYP?

**Good News:** You're already prepared!

- ✅ **Semester 6:** FYP domain selected, supervisor found, proposal drafted
- ✅ **Summer Break 3:** Internship (or building if no offer)
- ✅ **Semester 7:** FYP proposal finalized, implementation begins
- ✅ **Semester 8:** FYP completion

**If you're worried about FYP progress:**
- Spend **2-3 hours/week** on preliminary research during internship
- Read papers on weekends
- Keep in touch with supervisor via email
- Full FYP execution happens in Year 4, not summer

### The Trap to Avoid

❌ **"I'll skip internships to make my FYP perfect"**
- FYPs are graded Pass/Good/Excellent
- Internships open career doors (referrals, return offers, network)
- A "Good" FYP + 2 internships > "Excellent" FYP + 0 internships

✅ **"I'll pursue internship and plan FYP smartly"**
- Internship experience might even inspire your FYP
- Professional networks help with FYP (mentorship, resources)
- Career capital compounds faster

### Exception: The 10% Case

**You CAN skip internship for FYP if:**
- You have 2+ strong internships already (FAANG or equivalent)
- Your FYP is research-oriented (paper publication potential)
- You have external funding/grant for FYP work
- Your FYP is a startup MVP with revenue potential

**Even then:** A top company internship > FYP focus

| **Learning** | Industry practices | Self-directed deep dives |
| **Networking** | Professional contacts | Online community |
| **Portfolio** | 1 company project | 2-3 diverse projects |

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### For Interns:

**❌ Being a passive observer**
Ask for more challenging work if you finish early.

**❌ Not networking**
Your peers today are your network tomorrow.

**❌ Skipping documentation**
Future you (and your team) will thank present you.

**❌ Not asking for feedback**
Don't wait for the end-of-internship review.

### For Intensive Builders:

**❌ Building without validation**
Talk to potential users before building.

**❌ Tutorial hell**
Build projects, don't just follow tutorials.

**❌ Not shipping**
Done and imperfect > perfect and unreleased.

**❌ Working in isolation**
Share progress, get feedback, build in public.
